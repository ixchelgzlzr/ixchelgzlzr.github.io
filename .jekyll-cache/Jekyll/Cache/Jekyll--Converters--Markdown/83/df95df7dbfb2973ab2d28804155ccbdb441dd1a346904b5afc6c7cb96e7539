<p>It has been more than one year since El Club Eco-Evo Latinoamérica started. During this time, I have had the amazing opportunity to work with my colleagues and friends Luis, Diego, Ana and Daniel. We work hard for building spaces in which latinamerican scientists can connect and discuss their science in Spanish and Portuguese.
