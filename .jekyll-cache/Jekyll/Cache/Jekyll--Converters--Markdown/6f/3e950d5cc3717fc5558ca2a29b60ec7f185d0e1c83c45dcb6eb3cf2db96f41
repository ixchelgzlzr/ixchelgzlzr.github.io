<p>As part of a group project for the <a href="http://ds421.berkeley.edu">DS421</a> NRT program here at UC Berkeley, I led our teamâ€™s construction of a little web app called <a href="https://matthewkling.shinyapps.io/demographics_of_disaster/">Demographics of Disaster</a>. The visualization uses a mashup of extreme weather data and US Census data to let users explore the geographic distribution of populationsâ€™ exposure to climatic disasters. Itâ€™s also useful for exploring relationships within each of those two categories, such as the above illustrations of relationships between income and population density. The app is built entirely in R using Shiny for the bones and ggplot2 for the meat.</p>
