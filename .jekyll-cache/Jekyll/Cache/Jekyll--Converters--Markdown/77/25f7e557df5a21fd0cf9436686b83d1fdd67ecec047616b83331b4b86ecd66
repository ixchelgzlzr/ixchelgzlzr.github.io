<p>A couple years ago I was building an ecological niche model for a project on fog-loving coast redwood trees, and became frustrated by the nonexistence of gridded spatial data on fogginess. So I decided to take a stab at creating my own. Hereâ€™s the <a href="/assets/agu_fog_poster.pdf">poster</a> on that analysis that I put together for this weekâ€™s <a href="http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2016/">American Geophysical Union</a> fall meetingâ€”looking forward to getting feedback from some bona fide climatologists.</p>
