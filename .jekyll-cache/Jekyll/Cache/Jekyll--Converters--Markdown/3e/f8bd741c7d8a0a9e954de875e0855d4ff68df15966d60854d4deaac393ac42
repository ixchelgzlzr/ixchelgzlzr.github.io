<p>We have a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2017.0397">new paper</a> out today in <em>PhilTransB</em> that looks at the geographic ranges and evolutionary relationships of 5221 California plant species to identify priority locations for increased land protection. To accompany the paper I built the <a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/phylodiversity/">California Plant Phylodiversity Atlas</a>, a web application that lets users interact with the phylogeny, geography, and local community dimensions of our biodiversity dataset. It was a fun Shiny app to put together, including use of the plotly, leaflet, and DT libraries, as well as integration with images from the <a href="http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/eflora/">Jepson eFlora</a>. Check it out and let me know what you think!</p>
