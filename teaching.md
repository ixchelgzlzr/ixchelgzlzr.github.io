#### Workshops

In collaboration with Rocío Deanna and Stacey Smith, we developped a workshop that explains the fundamentals of Divergence Time Estimation using a Bayesian Total Evidence Dating approach. This workshop provides the background as well as the code to get started on applying this complex but exciting model on your own dataset.  You can find the recordings and tutorial in the [WORKSHOP SITE](https://ixchelgzlzr.github.io/TED_and_Paleobotany/about/). We have offered this workshop at Evolution 2022 and SSB 2023.
