<h2> About me </h2>
I am a biologist interested in the diversity and evolution of **fruit-free plants**, especially (but not exclusively) liverworts and conifers. I am a PhD candidate in the departement of Integrative Biology at UC Berkeley in the [Bryolab](https://bryolab.berkeley.edu). 
From the methodological perspective I like to explore phylogenetical methods that aim to understand diversity patterns by incorporating different sources of information like the fossil record, geographical records, morphology and molecular data.

Thanks for visiting my site!
