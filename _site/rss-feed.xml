				<title>Liverwort scales morphology, function, and evolution</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Complex thalloid liverworts occurr are cosmopolitan plants. Although they are commonly thought to occurr in wet environments, they also occurr in seasonal and dry environments. While doing fieldwork across California, I became interested in the “rolling up” mechanism that some xerophytic complex thalloid liverworts display.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Spatial phylogenetics: how branches are distributed in the geographic space</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Spatial phylogenetics is an approach that studies the distribution of lineages across space. For this, we draw on the available genetic and collection data to 1) build phylogenies, and 2) characterize de distribution of taxa, to then study what lineages are represented across geographic space.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>PAw GeoSSE: a paleogreographically aware GeoSSE model</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Phylogenetic biogeographers have understood range evolution as an historic process. As such, they have modeled the evolution of range as a character in an attribute of lineages that changes through time, using the character evolution machinery. Nevertheless, range evolution has been long recognized to have specific attributes that separate it from other chracters. For example, it is well known from a biological perspective that changes in the range or lineages are often associated with speciation events (e.g. allopatric speciation or jump dispersal). During my dissertation, I became interested in studying the evolution of the range in the family Aytoniaceae.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Calasterella californica genomics to understand the genetic diversity and population structure of liverworts</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the California state wide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ccgproject.org&quot;&gt;CCGP project&lt;/a&gt; (California Conservation Genomics Project), I have been studying the complex thalloid liverwort &lt;em&gt;Calasterella californica&lt;/em&gt; for the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
