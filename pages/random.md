### Adendum to "A March ramble" 

While checking some botanical texts, I ran into [a poem by Allen H. Curtiss](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43475770). In this poem he nicely describes the beauty of lichens, fungi, and mosses. Although I loved his appreciation to these beautiful groups, I felt like I needed to add a little paragraph for liverworts. Here is the result of an inspired and caffenated night:

_As if hiding from sight, and caressing the ground,  
There are wonderful liverworts hanging around.   
From the dark olive color to the bright red of wine,   
They equally embellish the leaf, soil, trunk, and vine.  
Nor the flower or fern could in so selfless approach,   
Offer housing to creatures like Porella in its pouch.  
And like rising from tales of a magical land,  
Are Marchantia’s umbrellas under which fairies stand.  
But the brightest of all them awakes from its sleep,  
As the purple scales reveal what they had their grip:  
It's Calasterella that came back to life,   
Triumphant protected from sun’s reckless knife._
