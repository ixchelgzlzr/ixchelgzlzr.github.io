## About me

Hi! I am an evolutionary biologist interested in the processes that generate plant diversity at different scales. I am originally from Mexico, where I studied Biology in my beloved Facultad de Ciencias (UNAM) working on arthropod-plant interactions. I obtained my masters degree at Instituto de Geología (UNAM) studying Cretaceous conifers in the family Cupressaceae. That was my first impactful exposure to phylogenetics! I recently obtained my PhD in the [Bryolab](https://bryolab.berkeley.edu), Department of Integrative Biology, at UC Berkeley.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the UC and Jepson Herbaria, at UC Berkeley, under Dr. Lúcia Lohmann's supervision. Our current research involves using cutting edge phylogenetic methods to study the biogeography and evolutionary timescale framework of various groups of Bignoniaceae.


### My research

Many of my current research questions focus on a group I am passionate about: liverworts. They comprise a group of spore bearing plants that are widespread, morphologically distinct, diverse, and often overlooked.
During my PhD, I discovered that I love evolutionary models that take into account information from the fossil and rock record. Therefore, a second axis of my work is using phylogenetic methods as a tool for making conservation decisions, and understanding evolutionary processes, especially when we incorporate the invaluable temporal, morphological, and phylogenetic information from the fossil record. This interest has lead me to collaborate with multiple researchers, working in a wide range of groups from dinosaurs, to flowering plants.

I love teaching and have developped a few materials that you can check in my [teaching page](/teaching).
