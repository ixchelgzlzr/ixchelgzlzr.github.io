In collaboration with my friend and colleague [Mick Song](https://michaelsongagradstudent.github.io), we used the sequencing of field collected liverworts in the species *C. californica* to study their associated microbiome. In this fun collaboration we learned that there is a core group of bacteria that is present across all samples. We also found that the differences observed in the composition is better explained by the genetics of the host liverwort. All of this opens interesting question about the role that liverworts might play in a selection mechanism of the bacteria in their microbiome.
