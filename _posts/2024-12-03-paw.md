Phylogenetic biogeographers have understood range evolution as an historic process. As such, they have modeled the evolution of range as a character in an attribute of lineages that changes through time, using the character evolution machinery. Nevertheless, range evolution has been long recognized to have specific attributes that separate it from other chracters. For example, it is well known from a biological perspective that changes in the range or lineages are often associated with speciation events (e.g. allopatric speciation or jump dispersal). During my dissertation, I became interested in studying the evolution of the range in the family Aytoniaceae.
